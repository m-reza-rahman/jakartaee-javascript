	<h2>JavaScript/HTML5 Clients with Jakarta EE 10</h2>
	<p>This application demonstrates how Jakarta EE 10 can be an extremely
		effective back-end for JavaScript/HTML5 clients. The application
		shows the use of APIs like WebSocket, JSON Processing, REST, CDI, 
		Validation, and Persistence. React is used as the JavaScript
		front-end framework. However, the choice of React is somewhat
		arbitrary and not central to the application. The concepts and back-end
		could also be utilized by Angular or Vue.</p>
	<p>There are two main parts of the application:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <a href="todo.jsp">to do interface</a> that utilizes REST.
		</li>
		<li>A <a href="chat.jsp">chat interface</a> that utilizes
			WebSocket.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that while this page is not secured, both the interfaces
		are secured using HTTP BASIC authentication and SSL. You can set the
		usernames and SHA-256 encrypted passwords in the SQL load scripts of
		the application source.</p>
	<p>
		The back-end REST and WebSocket APIs are documented <a
			href="backend.html">here</a>.
